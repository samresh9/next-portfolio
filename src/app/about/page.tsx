          <p>
            I am a CS student from Nepal, and I am all about coding cool stuff
            for the web. Whether it is backend magic or frontend flair, I love
            diving into projects that feel like exciting adventures.

            I am always seeking new ways to enhance my skills and the projects I
            work on. Each new pursuit is like a little adventure, filled with
            challenges to overcome and occasional unexpected twists. Still
            loving every minute of it. I remain committed to learning and
            delivering quality work.
